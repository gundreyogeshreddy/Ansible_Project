# Ansible_Project

𝘼𝙣𝙨𝙞𝙗𝙡𝙚 : Ansible is a open source configuration management tool used to automate infrastructure management and configuration,using ansible we can configure 100's of servers with just a single command. 

𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙞𝙩'𝙨 𝙬𝙤𝙧𝙠𝙨 :
Ansible uses playbook which is written in YAML syntax where we can define all our tasks and configurations that we want to applied on the all servers.
And we need inventory file or host file which consists of IP addressess of all the servers,on which we want to run the playbooks.
After we have the playbooks and defined the servers in the inventory file,we can run the ansible command which will run the playbook on the all servers defined in the inventory file using ssh.This is how ansible can be used to manage and configure multiple servers at once.✅
